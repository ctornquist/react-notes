# Title

React Notes
EC: I did the extra credit where when you click a note it jumps to the front by incrementing the Z index.

## What Worked Well
I like the styling a lot, the dragging is smooth, you can edit the text and title. It will work in realtime across multiple screens pretty well. I like the "jump to front" thing also. 

## What Didn't
The markdown thing works but I couldn't figure out how to make large images smaller, so you have to use an "icon" size image to see the whole thing. 
Also the notes spawn on top of one another, so if you create a bunch you have to move them around to see all of them.
