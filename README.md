# React Notes
 
This is a simple sticky notes style app I made using React and Bootstrap. It uses Google Firebase for persistent data storage and real time updates across users. A cool feature is that the notes will pop to the front when you click on them, and they are fully draggable. 

## To View
The app is hosted on surge using this link: [ct-cs52-reactnotes.surge.sh](ct-cs52-reactnotes.surge.sh)      
^link is weird on GH so might have to copy/paste

To view in local development environment:
1. yarn install
2. yarn start
